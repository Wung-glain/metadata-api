# Metadata Explorer API

## Overview

The **Metadata Explorer API** is a FastAPI-based RESTful API that allows users to interact with metadata. This project provides endpoints for CRUD operations to explore, manage, and retrieve metadata from a system. It is containerized using Docker and can be easily deployed with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment to AWS.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete** (CRUD) operations for metadata.
- Built with **FastAPI** for high-performance, async RESTful API.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database for storing metadata.
- Containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment.
- Swagger UI integrated for testing the API endpoints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- PostgreSQL (or any other database you want to use)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/metadata-explorer-api.git
cd metadata-explorer-api
2. Set up a virtual environment

If you want to work with the project locally, create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```
3. Install dependencies

setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Configure environment variables
Make sure to add any sensitive information (like database credentials or API keys) to a .env file. You can use .env.example as a template.

```bash

SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```
5. Run the application locally
You can now run the FastAPI server locally:

``bash

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Access the Swagger UI at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
```
