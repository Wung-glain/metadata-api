# Metadata Explorer API

## Overview

The **Metadata Explorer API** is a FastAPI-based RESTful API that allows users to interact with metadata. This project provides endpoints for CRUD operations to explore, manage, and retrieve metadata from a system. It is containerized using Docker and can be easily deployed with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment to AWS.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete** (CRUD) operations for metadata.
- Built with **FastAPI** for high-performance, async RESTful API.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database for storing metadata.
- Containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment.
- Swagger UI integrated for testing the API endpoints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- PostgreSQL (or any other database you want to use)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/metadata-explorer-api.git
cd metadata-explorer-api
2. Set up a virtual environment
If you want to work with the project locally, create and activate a Python virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
3. Install dependencies
bash 
setup
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure environment variables
Make sure to add any sensitive information (like database credentials or API keys) to a .env file. You can use .env.example as a template.

bash
Copy
Edit
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
5. Run the application locally
You can now run the FastAPI server locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Access the Swagger UI at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Docker Setup
1. Build Docker image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t metadata-explorer-api .
2. Run the Docker container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 metadata-explorer-api
Your application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

API Endpoints
1. GET /metadata
Retrieve all metadata entries.

bash
Copy
Edit
GET /metadata
2. GET /metadata/{id}
Retrieve a specific metadata entry by ID.

bash
Copy
Edit
GET /metadata/{id}
3. POST /metadata
Create a new metadata entry.

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /metadata
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "Sample Metadata",
  "description": "This is an example metadata entry."
}
4. PUT /metadata/{id}
